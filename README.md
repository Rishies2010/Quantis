# Quantis

A **ultra fast**, **light**, and **beautiful** shell for Linux Distributions.

### Whats's so special? 
- [ ] It is just one single C file.
- [ ] Dependencies are minimal; Just using standard C libraries and essential linux libs. Almost definitely you don't need anything extra to rn this.
- [ ] The entire thing runs in one single directory, with 3 files `(Quantis.o (The compiled binary), .qnrs, .qnhistory)There is no need of specific installation; Just give Quantis a folder to work in, and compile the C code. To remove entirely from the system, just delete the abovementioned 3 files.

> **Note :** If you added the shell to your _PATH_, you will need to remove it too from the respective shells.

## > Step to compile :
 - `gcc quantis.c -o Quantis`
